\section{``Passing the word'' Review}

\subsection{Main Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
 \item describes the importance of a manual, or written specification
 \item describes good manual style
 \item formal definitions
 \item the importance of meetings
 \item importance of multipel implementations
 \item product testing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Criticisms}
Shouldn't be too bad...

\subsection{Answers to questions}
\subsubsection{Good manual style}

In the author's view, a well-written manual must use precise, consistent
language, have quantized changes, and  it should also describe every detail the
user sees, omitting the details that the user does not see. The author mentions
that this can be done in a formal and/or informal style. In my opinion, an
informal style is more desireable, since quick ammendments and changes can be made to
the document as necessary, and using informal language makes it easier and less
daunting to read overall for the average person.

\subsubsection{Effective meetings}

The first type of meeting the author claims is effective is a weekly half-day
conference led by the chief architect, as well as all the architects, official
representatives of the hardware and software implementers, and market planners.
The second type of meeting is what the author refers to as an annual ``supreme
court session'', which lasts two weeks. In this type of meeting, the project
manager leads, with members from the architecture group,  the programmers' and
implementers' architectural representatives, and the managers of programming,
marketing, and im plementation efforts joining.

\subsubsection{Independent product-testing organization}

In the author's view, an independent product-testing organization acts  as a
``surrogate customer'', which allows for early detection of bugs and departure
from the design. I mostly agree with this viewpoint, since programmers are
human, and are prone to making mistakes like everyone else. Although it might
slow development time, having a dedicated team for finding these flaws before
deployment is important, so that the customer has a better overall experience.

\subsubsection{Are longer projects less often finished on time and within budget?}
Yes/No one sentence answer ok cool.
